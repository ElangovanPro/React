jsx->babel->react.createElement()->js object->render->browser

VDOM - virtual dom  (js object)--- js representation of HTML

js code are executing by JS engine 

how its rendering --react fiber algorithm (reconciliatation engine)

rendering - 2 phases -

1.render phase
 - build work in progress(WIP) fiber tree
 - diff b/t old VDOM vs New VDOM ===> diff algorthim
 - collect effect lists (placement, update, delete)
 - can be paused/resumed


2.commit phase
  - applying or executing the effect list(dom mutations, lifecycle)



==> applying to real or autual dom >Browser UI






over all flow

jsx-> react create element-> js object -> fiber tree -> (rendering phase) ->commit phase apply to dom -> browser UI
